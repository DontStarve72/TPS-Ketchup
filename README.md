# TPSKetchup
TPSKetchup is a simple fabric mod that ports Purpur's Configurable TPS Catchup patch to Mixin.

In vanilla, TPS catchup is the most noticeable after a long lag spike. It will cause the game to run over 20 TPS, making everything seem momentarily sped up. It can be frustrating, especially when you're already in a hazardous situation.

This mod is not configurable, unlike the Purpur patch. It simply disables TPS catchup, and the game will only ever run at most at 20 TPS.

This mod will also only affect the server. Meaning that, when installed onto a client, it will only work in singleplayer.
